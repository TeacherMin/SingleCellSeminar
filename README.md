# Single-cell Related Papers

This site contains candidate single-cell related papers which may be discussed later. Welcome to supplement.


* Kharchenko, Peter V., Lev Silberstein, and David T. Scadden. "Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis." Nature methods 11.7 (2014): 740-742. [[link]](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n7/full/nmeth.2967.html) I think this paper gives a very detailed description of scRNA-seq noise. But the method is hard to understand.
